# File Attachments

In edit mode, you can attach files to the article below the editor:

1. Click the upload area or drag and drop files into it.
2. Attached files are displayed as download links in the article view.

> **Note:** Images that should be embedded directly in the article text can be added via the **Bild einfügen** (Insert Image) button in the editor toolbar. File attachments are intended for documents that should be available as separate downloads.
