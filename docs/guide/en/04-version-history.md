# Version History

Every time you save an article, a new version is created automatically. This allows you to track changes and restore older versions if needed.

1. Select an article and click **Versionshistorie** (Version History).

## Restoring a Version

Click **Wiederherstellen** (Restore) on the desired version. The article opens in edit mode with the content of that version, so you can review and save it.

## Comparing Versions

2. Click **Versionen vergleichen** (Compare Versions).
3. Both versions are displayed side by side. You can also restore any version directly from this view via **Wiederherstellen** (Restore).
